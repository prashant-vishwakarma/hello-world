Random stuff

Hello World!
I call myself an enthusiast.
I've been working on many(sometimes stupid) projects just for fun.
I'm one of those guys who still own a 3rd Gen Intel Core 2 Duo Processor with 2GB DDR2 RAM.
Efficiency is the key here XD

That's all for random stuff.

Oh! btw I'm single XP

Update:
  Now I own a Laptop with i7 7700HQ GTX 1050 16GB DDR4 RAM
  For the next decade probably.
